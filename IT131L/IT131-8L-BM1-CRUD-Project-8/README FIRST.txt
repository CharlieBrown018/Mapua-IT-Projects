Before the CRUD application can be run, there are a series of preliminaries that must be followed to make things sail smoothly:

1. Import database "siomai.sql" to the MySQL or WorkBench and save it with the schema name "siomai". Then change the host password according to the host for each Python file that is listed below through a compiler or Python's IDLE. Before running the application, make sure that MySQL or Workbench has been started so that the database can be called.

2. Check File Manager and navigate for "View", check the "File Name Extensions" box if it hasn't been checked. Before renaming Customer, Ordered, Product and Transaction with their .exe file format - please disable any antivirus and/or Windows Defender through "Virus & Threat Protection Settings: Real-Time Protection.
